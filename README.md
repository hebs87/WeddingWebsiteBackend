# Kimmy & Sunny's Wedding Website API

A backend API for mine and my fiancee's wedding, using the Django REST Framework.

The purpose of this API is to store carousel images that will be called and rendered by a frontend React app. The API 
will also allow users to submit their RSVP information via the frontend form, which will subsequently stored in the 
database and displayed in the homepage of this API's website, to enable us to see which invited guests are attending.

## Future Updates

After the wedding, this API will be updated to store wedding images submitted by users in the database, which can 
subsequently be called and rendered by the frontend React app.
